# Class Details

## GPIO_Base
The GPIO_Base class is the base class for all other GPIO-related classes in our implementation. It includes methods for initializing and cleaning up the GPIO pins, as well as properties for getting and setting the pin mode and state.

The __init__() method initializes the GPIO pins and sets the pin mode to GPIO.BCM (Broadcom SOC channel numbering). The __del__() method cleans up the GPIO pins when the object is deleted.

The mode property allows you to get or set the pin mode (input or output) using the GPIO.IN and GPIO.OUT constants. The state property allows you to get or set the pin state (high or low) using the GPIO.HIGH and GPIO.LOW constants.

## Blink
The Blink class allows you to blink an LED or other output device connected to a GPIO pin at a specified interval. It inherits from the GPIO_Base class, so it includes all of the base class's methods and properties.

The __init__() method initializes the GPIO pin as an output, and the blink() method turns the pin on and off at the specified interval using the time.sleep() function.

## PWM
The PWM class allows you to generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal on a GPIO pin, which can be used to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of a motor. It inherits from the GPIO_Base class, so it includes all of the base class's methods and properties.

The __init__() method initializes the GPIO pin as an output and creates a PWM object with the specified frequency. The set_duty_cycle() method sets the duty cycle of the PWM signal, which determines the proportion of time the signal is high compared to low.

## PulseGenerator
The PulseGenerator class allows you to generate pulses of a specified duration and frequency on a GPIO pin, which can be used for various purposes such as triggering sensors or controlling servo motors. It inherits from the GPIO_Base class, so it includes all of the base class's methods and properties.

The __init__() method initializes the GPIO pin as an output. The generate_pulse() method generates a pulse of the specified duration and frequency by turning the pin on and off using the time.sleep() function.

## Fade
The Fade class allows you to smoothly fade an LED or other output device connected to a GPIO pin in and out by changing the PWM duty cycle over time. It inherits from the GPIO_Base and PWM classes, so it includes all of their methods and properties.

The fadein() method gradually increases the PWM duty cycle from 0 to 100, while the fadeout() method gradually decreases it from 100 to 0.

## Buzzer
The Buzzer class allows you to control a buzzer or speaker connected to a GPIO pin by generating tones of a specified frequency and duration. It inherits from the GPIO_Base class, so it includes all of the base class's methods and properties.

The __init__() method initializes the GPIO pin as an output. The play_tone() method generates a tone of the specified frequency and duration by turning the pin on and off at the specified intervals using the time.sleep() function.

## Switch
The Switch class allows you to control a switch or relay connected to a GPIO pin by turning it on or off, or toggling it between the on and off states. It inherits from the GPIO_Base class, so it includes all of the base class's methods and
